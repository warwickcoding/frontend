Create a form that has the following:
- It asks you for you first name, last name, age
- Asks for your email, telephone number, address
- a Submit button that has a value of “Register!”

###Exercise 3
[SOLUTION](http://codepen.io/zlahham/pen/GoLGjj)
Create a form that has the following features:

- A label to distinguish it
- A search box to input text
- a Submit button that has a value of “Search now!”
- When clicked, it should send you to `http://www.google.com/search`
- For example, when I type in "Cats", it should send me to a Google page that already has the search content for Cats

*Hint*: Look up the `action` and `method` attributes for the `<form>` element.

###Exercise 4

Create a Pizza ordering webpage. It should have everything from the sign up to the pizza choices, including topping choices.

- Create a Sign up form for it first
- Each pizza must come with optional toppings
- The mandatory toppings should be preselected

*Hint*: Look at another website and take inspiration. Dominos or Pizza Hut

###Exercise 5
