Exercises
---------
Please read the following instructions carefully. Remember, you have to be on Koding.com.
Another reminder is to create all your files under the "Web" directory.

###Exercise 1
[SOLUTION](http://codepen.io/zlahham/pen/yerEgE)

For this exercise, you will have to do the following:
- In your Koding editor, create a new folder and call it `session-4`
- Inside that folder, create an `exercise-1` folder
- Find the folder for `session-4` in this repository
- Copy the contents of `index.html` and `styles.css` into two new files with the same names in your newly created `exercise-1` folder in Koding
- Change the content inside the `index.html` to make it about you!
- Replicate the styles that are shown in the screenshot below.

You are expected to add a minimum of **6** new rules to the `styles.css` file and 1 line to the `index.html` in order to finish this exercise.

###Exercise 2
[SOLUTION](http://codepen.io/zlahham/pen/bEJKWo)

For this exercise, you will have to do the following:

- Same initial setup as before, create a new folder that is called `exercise-2`
- Under this repo, find the folder for `exercise_2` and copy the code inside `index.html` and paste it in Koding inside a file that you will create with the same name.
- Insert the warwickCoding logo that is in the folder. Make sure that it is sized properly.
- Get rid of all `<br>` tags and find something more suitable through CSS, *HINT*: Display
- Move the CSS into a separate file.
- Add another row to the table that include the Ruby course
- Colour the borders of that table
- Seperate the page into different sections, for example: About, Schedule, Registration, Contact

###Exercise 3
