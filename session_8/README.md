Recap for Sessions 6 & 7
------------------------
Session 6 was all about linking our knowledge of HTML with CSS in a project that we built from scratch! We then moved on to learning more about HTML and CSS when we introduced Bootstrap, a framework that makes it easier for us to work with CSS and HTML.

For those of you that haven't had the chance to complete the tutorials, please feel free to do so before moving on to the next section.

Intro to Github Pages
---------------------
As this is our last session, it's about time to introduce a great feature that is provided by this website, [Github](https://github.com). For those of you that don't know, Github is a [`git`]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_software ) repository hosting service that allows developers to collaborate on projects together. Think of it as a Google Drive for your code, well sort of... We are not going to go into how to use it or how to use the technology that it relies on, `git`, as this is outside the scope of this course. However, I would recommend that you learn how to use `git` and Github, because it is a very important skill to have by any software developer. Checkout this [tutorial](http://try.github.com/) if you are interested in learning more about `git`.

Moving on to the important bit. As previously mentioned, Github provides many features that are beloved by the open source community because they are provided for free. The one feature that we will be exploring today is the [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Github pages allows you to host your "static" website straight from a repository on Github! In other words, we can have a website live in minutes for free! Quite neat, eh?

Another cool thing about Github pages is that you can create as many websites as you want.

Here are a few of the thousands of websites that are hosted on Github pages:
- [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)
- [Facebook's React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

It is also worth pointing out that with Github pages, you get access to a great and expansive Content Delivery Network ([CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)). Which means your content will be loaded much faster anywhere in the world.
