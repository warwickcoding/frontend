Recap for Sessions 6 & 7
------------------------
Session 6 was all about linking our knowledge of HTML with CSS in a project that we built from scratch! We then moved on to learning more about HTML and CSS when we introduced Bootstrap, a framework that makes it easier for us to work with CSS and HTML.

For those of you that haven't had the chance to complete the tutorials, please feel free to do so before moving on to the next section.

Intro to Github Pages
---------------------
Github, for those of you that don't know about it yet, is a `git` repository hosting service that allows developers to collaborate on projects together. Think of it as a Google Drive for your code, well sort of... We are not going to go into how to use it or how to use the technology that it relies on, `git`, as this is outside the scope of this course. I would recommend that you learn how to use `git` and Github, because it is a very important skill to have by any software developer.
