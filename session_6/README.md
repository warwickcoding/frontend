Session outline:
- Installing Atom

- Quick Recap
- Tutorial

In this session we will be following a tutorial to solidify our existing knowledge of HTML and CSS. After you are done with the tutorial, please attempt to tackle the exercises that follow.

For the tutorial, I encourage you to work in pairs and discuss the steps with the person next to you. Make use of all the previous sessions' resources and try to get into the habit of going to Google/MDN/w3Schools to find answers. If you are stuck let us know.

I hope you enjoy this!

Tutorial

In this tutorial we will be build a page that will look similar to the this:

![project 1](../images/session_6/frontend_session_6-1.png)

This tutorial will be broken down into the following parts:
1. Deciding what our page will initially look like
2. Setting up our HTML page
3. Styling each section individually
4. Wrapping up and making the final modifications

### 1. Deciding on the content.
We want our page to have a navigation bar, a hero section, a places visited section, favourite songs, a mini resume, and finally a footer.

Now we know what kind of content our page will contain and we will then begin to write up the HTML code to set it up.

### 2. Setting up the HTML
